Welcome to U.S. Energy Information Administrationâ€™s (EIA) Contributing Guide for the **dash-benchmark** repository.  Thank you for investing your time to our projects! Please read our Code of Conduct which we hold very important to creating a positive environment for contributors.  

To get an overview of an individual project, please see the README.MD file for an individual repository.  EIA's main profile README.md can be found [here](https://github.com/EIAgov/EIAgov/blob/main/README.md) and the README.md for the dash-benchmark can be found [here](https://github.com/EIAgov).

The email address for each Project Team can be found in the README.md and/or CONTRIBUTE.md for each repository.

EIA will provide written feedback to a contributor for any issue/bug/feature/change expressed. The process and reasons used to reach a decision will be described in each contribution resolution. The goal is to communicate a final decision within 30 days of submission, but larger contributions may require a design review and therefore require longer review periods.

## Do you have an issue?  Did you find a bug?
Please direct issues or bugs to [EIA-DASH-BENCHMARK-GITHUB@eia.gov](mailto:EIA-DASH-BENCHMARK-GITHUB@eia.gov?subject=[GitHub]%20bug). The EIA dash-benchmark Team will communicate all issues or bugs (status/resolution) via an ISSUES file within each repository.

If you are unable to find an open issue addressing the problem or bug, please open a new one by emailing [EIA-DASH-BENCHMARK-GITHUB@eia.gov](mailto:EIA-DASH-BENCHMARK-GITHUB@eia.gov?subject=[GitHub]%20issue). Be sure to include a title and clear description, with as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case (e.g., a Minimal Reproducible Example or MRE) demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring. 

## Do you intend to propose a new feature or change an existing one?
Suggest your change by sending an email to EIA-DASH-BENCHMARK-GITHUB@eia.gov. By contributing your code, you agree to license your contribution under the [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/EIAgov/EIAgov/blob/main/LICENSE).

## Do you have questions/concerns about the source code?
Ask any question or express any concerns about a project to EIA dash-benchmark Team via EIA-DASH-BENCHMARK@eia.gov.
